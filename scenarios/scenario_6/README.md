# You're Special

A special task for special people that requires special measures. Write a program in C++ that computes the 16th fibonacci number (987) and prints it to stdout. Do not use the `if`, `for`, or `while` keyword. Do not use the `?` operator.

Bonus points for:
* Computationn happens at compile time and you are able to prove it.
* You print the 42nd fibonacci number (267914296) as well

## Example output

```sh
$ ./special
987
267914296
```
